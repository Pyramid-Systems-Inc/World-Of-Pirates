# AI Plan

## Phase 1 (MVP)
- Rule-based: Seek, Broadside, Disengage
- Pathing: simple steering + collision avoidance (raycasts)
- Target selection: nearest player or flee at low HP

## Phase 2
- Formation logic and flanking
- Personality per faction

## ML-Agents (Later)
- Train positioning rewards (crossing the T, maintain firing arc)
- Use curriculum: calm → waves → storms
